Last Updated: 25 Mar 23
New at release 1.2.5

 - Modified the RunABL code in varsin.cfg, to:
	1. Perform BED_MESH_CLEAR before running BED_MESH_CALIBRATE
	2. Explicitly name the BED_MESH PROFILE=default

Known Issues at this release: (As observed on the Test Printer)

1. If PAUSE is pressed while the printer is waiting for a heater to achieve a temperature target, the printer may show the print paused screen, and may park the head, but not actually be paused... In such cases, when the target is achieved, the toolhead may move back to continue the print, with the screen still showing Print Paused. While parked, in that case, trying to change filament will instead result only in a "Busy..." message.
Work around is: Avoid using PAUSE until after the printer completes printing the purge line.
2. If you control your printer from multiple screens (e.g. Mainsail, KlipperScreen AND your DWIN screen), then some status info on the DWIN screen may become out of synch.  e.g. The Nozzle LED On/Off status indication may become out of synch with the actual printer state.


NOTE: I could use a bit of help to analyse and modify the Python bits of the Klipper side.  Please join me in the Discussions section, if you think you can help.  

Cheers!
