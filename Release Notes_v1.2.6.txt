Last Updated: 14 Aug 23
New at release 1.2.6

    - Added conditional M600 command to Start_Print macro 
      - will pause print if no filament in runout sensor when Start_Print runs, but ONLY if Runout Sensor is Enabled.
    - Added support for the new features of DWIN_SET v0.3.8-beta
      - added save_variables support and all related macros to DGUS-Reloaded.cfg, to support the new Print Menu functions
      - modified CR6.cfg and printer.cfg
      - updated varsin.cfg, varsout.cfg, routines.cfg and t5uid1.py
      - Added a variables.cfg file to the t5uid1 folder, with the default last_file name of "None".
      - Added logic that alerts the user if it detects "None" in variables.cfg when the user attempts to print the previous job
      - Added macros to enable|disable the runout sensor and to test the current state of the sensor
      - Added macros to support the new Print Menu selection and operation
    - Incorporated some minor edits from Desuuu, which he thinks improve compatibility with Python3
    - Added support for Exclude Objects while printing
    - Enabled the Klipper RESPOND function, so that the application can issue alerts and prompts to the Mainsail Console.


Known Issues at this release: (As observed on the Test Printer)

1. If PAUSE is pressed while the printer is waiting for a heater to achieve a temperature target, the printer may show the print paused screen, and may park the head, but not actually be paused... In such cases, when the target is achieved, the toolhead may move back to continue the print, with the screen still showing Print Paused. While parked, in that case, trying to change filament will instead result only in a "Busy..." message.
Work around is: Avoid using PAUSE until after the printer completes printing the purge line.
2. If you control your printer from multiple screens (e.g. Mainsail, KlipperScreen AND your DWIN screen), then some status info on the DWIN screen may become out of synch.  e.g. The Nozzle LED On/Off status indication may become out of synch with the actual printer state.


NOTE: I could use a bit of help to analyse and modify the Python bits of the Klipper side.  Please join me in the Discussions section, if you think you can help.  

Cheers!
