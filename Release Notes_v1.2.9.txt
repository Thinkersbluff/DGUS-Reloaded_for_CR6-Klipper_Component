New at release 1.2.9

	- brightness: 100 commented-out of DGUS-Reloaded.cfg, to fix Issue#37
          Display now powers-up with the last brightness level selected when SAVE_CONFIG was used, instead of starting at 100%
	  

Known Issues at this release: (As observed on the Test Printer)

 - If you select a different screen brightness level, but do not use SAVE_CONFIG, the screen will boot up to the last brightness level selected when SAVE_CONFIG was last run

NOTE: I could use a bit of help to analyse and modify the Python bits of the Klipper side.  Please join me in the Discussions section, if you think you can help.  

Cheers!
