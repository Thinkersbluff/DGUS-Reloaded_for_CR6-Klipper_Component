New at release 1.2.4

 - Adjusted Tune page for Paused Prints, to enable the Filament Change function added to that page.
 - Modified the script invoked by pressing the STOP print button on the Printing Status screen, to call PAUSE before it calls CANCEL_PRINT.
   Seems to have resolved many of the "bad behaviour" problems.  TBD whether it solves them all.

Known Issues at this release: (As observed on the Test Printer)

1. CANCEL_PRINT leaves Mainsail/Klipper printer status as Cancelled instead of Completed.  Klipper acts as though the printer is still printing & continues to show print time remaining.  Can not start another print or move axes.  Forced to do Emergency Stop, to regain control of printer.


NOTE: I could use a bit of help to analyse and modify the Python bits of the Klipper side.  Please join me in the Discussions section, if you think you can help.  

Cheers!
