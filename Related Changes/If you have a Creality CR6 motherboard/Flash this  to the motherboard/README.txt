The CrealityMB_Klipper.bin file in this folder was made by using the following instructions, while logged into the Klipper Host:

$ cd klipper
$ make menuconfig
Select the settings shown in the screen image "Make Menuconfig for ERA or 4.5.3 or 4.5.2.jpg"
Enter Q
Enter Y
$ make

You can either do that yourself, or just flash the CrealityMB_Klipper.bin file to your system.
