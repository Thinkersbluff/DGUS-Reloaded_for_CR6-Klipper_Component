I strongly recommend using KIAUH to manage the installation, update, removal of Klipper, Mainsail & Moonraker, on your system.
It is extremely easy to understand and use, and quite robust.

The repos.txt file in this folder enables you to select the most recent release of the DGUS-Reloaded-for-CR6_Klipper-Component.  If you use KIAUH to select a custom Klipper repository, then KIAUH will manage removing whatever Klipper was there before & installing the newest release of DGUS-Reloaded.

If you want to remove DGUS-Reloaded and return to the Klipper3D/Master version, KIAUH can do that too.  This repos.txt file cotains pointers to both repositories, just pick the one you want it to use.


NOTE: If you had previously installed a plug-in like stable_z_home, which use symbolic linking as part of the installation, you will need to recreate those symbolic links, each time you use KIAUH to install Klipper again.
