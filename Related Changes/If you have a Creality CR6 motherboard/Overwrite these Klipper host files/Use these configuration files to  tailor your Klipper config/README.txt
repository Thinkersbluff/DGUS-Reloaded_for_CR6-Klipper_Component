The files in these zipfiles were downloaded from the Mainsail Machine of the test printer, at release time.

While they are uniquely configured to run on the test system, they also provide you with a reference that should help you figure out how to tailor your own setup to work with DGUS-reloaded_CR6Community_Edition.

NOTE: At release 1.2.2, the test printer was converted from a BTT SKR CR6 motherboard to a Creality ERA 1.1.0.3 motherboard.



One reasonable source of example CR6 Klipper Configuration files, if you are moving to Klipper for the first time, is this repo by K2Van:
https://github.com/KoenVanduffel/CR-6_Klipper

It is on my "ToDo list" to eventually modify these configs to work with the DGUS-Reloaded Klipper, but I am presently focused on stabilizing that firmware.
