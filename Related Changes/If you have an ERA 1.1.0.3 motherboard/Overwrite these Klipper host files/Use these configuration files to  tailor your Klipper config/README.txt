The files in this zipfile were downloaded from the test printer, at release time.

While they are uniquely configured to run on the test system, they also provide you with a reference that should help you figure out how to tailor your own setup to work with DGUS-reloaded_CR6Community_Edition.

NOTE: At release 1.2.2, the test printer was converted from a BTT SKR CR6 motherboard to a Creality ERA 1.1.0.3 motherboard.

Future updates will be developed and validated on the ERA board.
