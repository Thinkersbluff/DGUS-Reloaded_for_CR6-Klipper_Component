These files were built by updating the pin numbers in the ERA/4.5.3 files to be those of the BTT SKR CR6 board.

While they are uniquely configured to run on the test system, they also provide you with a reference that should help you figure out how to tailor your own setup to work with DGUS-reloaded_CR6Community_Edition.
There are copious notes throughout the files where they require you to tailor them for your own system.

IMPORTANT: At release 1.2.2, the test printer was converted from a BTT SKR CR6 motherboard to a Creality ERA 1.1.0.3 motherboard.
There is, therefore, a risk that I may make a typo in the process of updating printer.cfg for the BTT board, since I am not able to test this version on my printer.
Please let me know if you find a problem with any of them.
