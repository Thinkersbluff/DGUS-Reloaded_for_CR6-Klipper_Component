The files in this folder have been updated to capture the most recent configurations downloaded from the test printer at release time, while maintaining the configuration settings unique to the BTT SKR CR6 motherboard.

While they are uniquely configured to run on the test system, they also provide you with a reference that should help you figure out how to tailor your own setup to work with DGUS-reloaded_CR6Community_Edition.

NOTE: At release 1.2.2, the test printer was converted from a BTT SKR CR6 motherboard to a Creality ERA 1.1.0.3 motherboard.
There is, therefore, a risk that I made a typo in the process, since I am not able to test this version on my printer.
Please let me know if you find a problem with any of them.
